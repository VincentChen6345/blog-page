          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the
          languages of the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>the closing tag</li>
          <li>the actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them
        </p>

<!--Semantic HTML
Specific HTML tags are just boxes that tells HTML what the content is.
e.g. using <nav> specifies that the content inside is the navigation. Other examples are <p> <h1> <nav>. Technically they all do the same thing as <div> which is a normal box. 
    Semantic HTML gives our elements meaning. It allows for search engine optimisation, allowing google to understand our content. It also improves accessibility i.e. people who use screenreaders. 
    We should not just think about how they look like, we should think about what they mean and what they stand for
